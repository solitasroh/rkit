# skill-status - Skill Inventory Report

로드된 스킬 목록을 core(bkit 기본)와 project-local로 구분하여 표시.

## Command: `/skill-status`

### Step 1: Scan Core Skills

1. Read bkit core skills directory:
   `~/.claude/plugins/cache/bkit-marketplace/bkit/*/skills/`
2. For each skill directory, read SKILL.md frontmatter:
   - name, classification, description (first line)
3. Count total core skills

### Step 2: Scan Project-Local Skills

1. Read project skills directory:
   `.claude/skills/project/*/SKILL.md`
2. For each skill, read frontmatter
3. Count total project skills

### Step 3: Detect Conflicts

1. Compare skill names between core and project
2. If same name exists in both: mark as "override" (project wins)
3. If project skill triggers overlap with core: mark as "shadow"

### Step 4: Display Report

```

```

### Options

**`/skill-status --detail`**: Show full descriptions and trigger keywords for each skill.

**`/skill-status --conflicts`**: Show only skills with naming conflicts or trigger overlaps.

## Skill Layer Priority

```
Priority (high to low):
1. .claude/skills/project/   (project-local, git-tracked)
2. ~/.claude/plugins/.../skills/  (bkit core, plugin-managed)
3. ~/.claude/skills/          (user global, if any)
```

When a project skill has the same name as a core skill, the project skill takes precedence.
This is the "2-layer override" pattern.
